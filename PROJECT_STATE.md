# SpeakLink Project State

Last updated: 2026-07-23
Baseline branch: `feature/baseline-verification`

## Current architecture

```text
HQ Browser
  -> React Dashboard
  -> FastAPI Server
  -> Secure WebSocket
  -> Windows Receiver Agent
  -> FFmpeg / Windows Audio
  -> Amplifier
  -> Store Speakers
```

The checked-in application currently provides the React HQ dashboard, FastAPI
API, SQLite persistence, JWT-based HQ authentication, and WebSocket endpoints.
The Windows Receiver Agent is not implemented or verified as part of this
baseline. WebSocket routing state is held in memory, so the backend must run
with one Uvicorn worker.

## Verified local baseline

- Python 3.12.10, Yarn 1.22.22, and FFmpeg 8.1.2 are installed locally.
- The backend starts successfully at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` with one worker.
- The React frontend compiles and starts successfully at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Local login works with credentials held in local configuration.
- The dashboard and seeded stores load after authentication.
- Stores appear OFFLINE when no receiver is connected; this is expected.
- The configurable Windows SQLite path fixes are present.

These statements are the verified starting state supplied for this baseline.
They do not establish receiver playback, audible speakers, production
readiness, or end-to-end WebSocket audio streaming.

## Git baseline

- Branch: `feature/baseline-verification`
- `07a8392 fix: preserve configurable SQLite path`
- `e540ae8 fix: resolve SQLite path on Windows`
- `ae4c368 chore: import original SpeakLink baseline`
- The working tree was clean before this baseline task began.
- Local `.env`, database, WAL, and SHM files are ignored and untracked.

## Exact startup commands

Backend, from the repository root in PowerShell:

```powershell
Set-Location backend
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
& .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m uvicorn server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --workers 1
```

Frontend, from the repository root in a second PowerShell window:

```powershell
Set-Location frontend
yarn start
```

Stop each process with `Ctrl+C` in its own terminal.

## Known issues

- No Windows Receiver Agent is connected or verified.
- Receiver playback, FFmpeg decoding/output, amplifier delivery, and audible
  speaker output have not been tested.
- WebSocket broadcast and receiver state is process-local and supports only one
  backend worker.
- The current broadcast start path records a target as `playing` when a PLAY
  command is sent to an online receiver. That is not playback confirmation and
  must not be treated as such in future design.
- Receiver connection, audio receipt, playback confirmation, and speaker
  verification are not yet modeled as separate end-to-end states.

## Current security limitations

- CORS defaults to `*` unless `CORS_ORIGINS` is configured.
- HQ WebSocket authentication currently places JWTs in query parameters.
- Receiver tokens are used in receiver URLs and are returned by store APIs.
- Development credential defaults exist in current application/UI code.
- JWT revocation is not implemented; logout only removes the browser token.
- TLS termination, secret rotation, receiver provisioning, authorization roles,
  audit retention, and production hardening are not verified.

Do not place raw receiver tokens in production URLs. Do not print or log
passwords, JWTs, or receiver tokens.

## Current testing limitations

- The pre-existing integration suite was designed for an old Emergent endpoint
  and includes destructive/write scenarios.
- It now requires an explicit test URL, explicit isolated-database confirmation,
  and environment-supplied test credentials; non-local targets require a clearly
  named opt-in flag.
- The minimal smoke suite imports the app only after assigning a pytest
  temporary SQLite database and runtime-only test secrets.
- The smoke scope covers app import, SQLite connection, `/docs`,
  `/openapi.json`, unauthenticated `/api/auth/me`, development login, and an
  authenticated store listing.
- WebSocket streaming, concurrent receivers, audio delivery, Windows playback,
  and acoustic speaker output remain untested.
- Existing `backend/pytest.ini` xdist configuration is preserved.

## Database safety

The real database is `backend/speaklink_live.db` unless `SPEAKLINK_DB_PATH` is
configured. It must not be deleted, renamed, reset, or reseeded as a testing
shortcut. Automated smoke tests use a unique pytest temporary database. Future
schema changes require migrations that preserve transactions, foreign keys,
indexes, and existing data.

## Next recommended engineering task

Define and test a receiver-state contract before building the Windows Receiver
Agent. The contract should keep `CONNECTED`, `AUDIO_RECEIVING`,
`PLAYBACK_CONFIRMED`, and `SPEAKER_VERIFIED` separate, specify acknowledgements
and timeouts, and prevent a sent PLAY command from being reported as confirmed
playback.
